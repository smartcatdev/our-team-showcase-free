Our Team Showcase allows you to easily create and display your team members & staff and show them on your site with ease. Your visitors will see a beautiful & animated
list of your team, with their pictures, links to social icons, and link to each member page. 

Each member can be edited. When you create or edit a team member, you will be able to add links to contact email, phone number, links to social media( facebook, linkedin, twitter, google plus, instagram & linkedin ), as well as a personal website.
You can also link in your posts to a user. This way, you can keep the viewer on your site, and recommend content to them.

First, install and activate the plugin. You will be automatically re-directed to the plugin settongs page. Select your preferred settings and colors, Add your staff, upload pictures and finally
add the shortcode [our-team] to the page, post or widget where you want to display them. You can also set the order that the members appear in with a user-friendly drag & drop interface.

If your theme has a sidebar, you can use the extra custom sidebar widget to display the team members in the sidebar.

The pro version provides you with 4 additional and very unique Team templates and 3 Single Member templates. Impress your site visitors by using the pro version which includes a Honeycomb layout, Scrolling Carousel, Stacked
